They adeptly glean prey items from the surface of twigs, leaves and buds. On occasion, they may hover or even flycatch, but it is more usual to see these acrobatic passerines hang upside down from a branch, clinging on with a single foot. This Sooty Tit has just taken a prey item while foraging in the upper branches of a small tree.

Published in HBW Volume 9 on page 724. Original HBW caption: Wagtails living on fastrunning streams tend to forage by picking at the water or rocks for insects. They run about quickly, or walk, wagging their tails conspicuously, and they will also fly up a short distance to catch insects in flight. This Grey Wagtail reveals its adroit foraging technique, and its penchant for aquatic larvae, by snatching one from rushing water. In fact, so keen is this species on wriggly prey, especially in winter, that one bird entered a fishing-tackle shop in Liverpool and collected maggots from a tray. In summer, adult dipteran flies were found to form an important part of the diet of this species in Wales, contributing 55-64% of items taken by adults. Similar results were obtained at other European sites. IBC scientific name: Motacilla cinerea cinerea. Elevation: 539 m.

Some, like the Desert Wheatear, are predominantly sandy in colour with darker wings or masks, while others, such as the Whitecrowned Wheatear, are more dramatically pied, but almost all are characterized by a conspicuous patch of white on the rump and tail-sides; indeed this “white arse” gives rise, in refined form, to their English name. Most of the 21 species of Oenanthe live in open, rocky or arid landscapes, and none has much patience with trees. A recurrent theme in the genus is that of polymorphism, wherein different phenotypes regularly interbreed, producing offspring that match one morph or another, rather than intermediate hybrids. In some cases breeding is more or less assortative, and it is difficult to judge whether each particular phenotype is a morph, a subspecies, or indeed an incipient species.

The bare yellow skin around the eye of the south-east Asian Black-collared Starling extends in a triangle behind the eye. The yellow coloration is probably caused by carotenoid pigments, which cannot be synthesized by birds, and must be acquired in the diet.

It is similar in size, some plumage features, and its disproportionately long tail, to the Long-tailed Rosefinch (Uragus sibiricus). But in its bill structure, horny palate and song, it resembles the Reed Bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus), and it has sometimes been classed as a bunting. Mitochondrial- DNA analysis suggests that Przevalski’s Rosefinch is a relict member of a lineage that is as old as, or older than, other families of finches.

The male is dominant in winter, but becomes subordinate as the breeding season advances. However, in the European Greenfinch (Carduelis chloris), this is often interrupted by outbursts of the “sleeked wings-raised” display by the male, which has a strong aggressive component. This display becomes very much less frequent just before copulation starts. Prior to and during copulation, male finches fluff out their body feathers, as demonstrated by this Black-headed Greenfinch. IBC scientific name: Chloris ambigua ambigua.

Within Brazil, the forestdwelling subspecies sterea, shown here, also has louder and more complex songs than the subspecies argentina, found in semi-open country.

This is a bird of open country, and it will breed on cliffs, in burrows, tree holes or crevices distant from water, laying 6-16 creamy-white eggs, incubated for 30 days. The Ruddy Shelduck is usually found in pairs or small groups and rarely forms large flocks. However, moulting and wintering gatherings on chosen lakes or slow rivers can be very large.The Ruddy Shelduck is a distinctive species, 58–70 cm long with a 110–135 cm wingspan. It has orange-brown body plumage and a paler head. The wings are white with black flight feathers. It swims well, and in flight looks heavy, more like a goose than a duck. The sexes of this striking species are similar, but the male has a black ring at the bottom of the neck in the breeding season summer, and the female often has a white face patch. The call is a loud wild honking. Ruddy Shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea), also called Brahminy Duck, is a common winter visitor in India. This bird is found in large wetlands, rivers with mud flats and shingle banks. Found in large congregation on lakes and reservoirs. It breeds in high altitude lakes and swamps in Jammu & Kashmir. Arrives in north India by October and departs by April. The genus name Tadorna comes from Celtic roots and means ""pied waterfowl"", essentially the same as the English ""shelduck"".

It belongs to a family of five birds, the Fregatidae, which have the largest wingspan to body weight ratio of any bird. This bird has the ability to stay airborne for more than a week at a time allowing them to have a large foraging range. It spends a large proportion of time at sea, plucking squid and fish from the surface of the water. They also employ a method of feeding called kleptoparasitism; where they steal other birds’ food by forcing them to regurgitate. Its breeding habitat is affected by invasive yellow crazy ant, which is a key threat to many species on the island. They are also threatened by hunting, getting trapped in fishing gear, habitat destruction for phosphate mining, and the ecological fallout from the phosphate dust. Much of the breeding colony now lies within the Christmas Island National Park, but almost 10% of the population nests outside this area which does not have any formal protection. With such small numbers surviving, every individual counts and conservation measures must protect the entire population. Elevation: 0 m.

The great frigatebird (Fregata minor) is a large seabird in the frigatebird family. There are major nesting populations in the tropical Pacific(including the Galapagos Islands) and Indian Oceans, as well as a tiny population in the South Atlantic. The great frigatebird is a lightly built, large seabird up to 105 cm long with predominantly black plumage. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism; the female is larger than the adult male and has a white throat and breast, and the male's scapular feathers have a purple-green sheen. In the breeding season, the male is able to distend its striking red gular sac. The species feeds on fish taken in flight from the ocean's surface (mostly flying fish), and indulges in kleptoparasitism less frequently than other frigatebirds.

It spears a fish underwater, bringing it above the surface, tossing and juggling it before swallowing the fish head first. The body remains submerged as it swims, and the slender neck alone is visible above the water, which accounts for the colloquial name of snakebird.

However we have seen both the male and female at the same time, with the male performing a mating ritual in front of the female. Both of them had white irises. Speaking to the local guide, he also confirmed that all the adult pitta he had seen before had white irises. Only the juvenile Sula Pitta has a brown iris.

Remarks: Courtship feeding is frequently seen in terns. For instance, in an effort to lure females to their territories in the nesting area, a male Saunder's Tern carries a fish around the breeding colony and displays it to prospective mates. After a pair bond is formed, during the ""honeymoon period"" the male tern actually feeds the female, and soon thereafter they begin to copulate. During the following five to ten days, both sexes feed themselves, but the male also frequently feeds the increasingly dependent female. For the few days prior to egg laying the female is fed almost exclusively by the male, but this activity declines rapidly as the second and third eggs are laid.

It flew a few metres away, swooped low onto the water surface and dropped the dropping into the water. Maybe this is their way of preventing predators from finding the nest. I am not too sure, but I noticed quite a number of fantail nests were built over water. -Ng. Date added to OBI: June 15, 2010.

We counted 25+ traps along the road and released all trapped birds.  It is very unfortunate as there seems no real reason for hunting. Last year, we had seen serious hunting for the pot in Nagaland. Here, villages seem to have enough sources of meat in domestic animals (pig, chicken, etc.) to resort to killing birds for the pot. Probably tradition or just a pastime.

Remarks: I just returned from my maiden trip to various parts of the fabulous Chilika Lake in Orissa / Odisha -- one of the world's largest wetlands / lagoons. Wildlife (and in particular birdlife) in Chilika is amazing because of its massive size as well as many sub-habitats.   I found this bird while on a quiet boat ride in the marshes. It was eating aquatic plants. I think this has been an overlooked bird in India's wetlands, given that it has been popping up all over Western India in winter in the last few years. There don't seem to be many records from E India.   Chilika deserves visits from serious birders / photographers. The opportunities are immense and easy. After just one trip, I won't hesitate to term it the 'Bharatpur of the East'! - RS. Date added to OBI: March 02, 2012.

It's quite a pain trying to shoot anything from a boat, and, especially with an 800mm lens!

I made 36-frames of a single display that lasted several seconds and a photoshop expert helped piece them together to reveal this fantastic display ritual (we discarded 12-images as there was too much clutter). Luckily the bird remained perfectly horizontal to me during the entire display so all images are to scale. Some of the background had to be created as the images didn't have that detail. After stitching, the master file was half a gig and can cover a wall!  The Bengal Florican is the rarest bustard in the world and the grasslands of Manas in India support the largest population. Manas is now free from insurgency issues and wildlife is looking up. A local NGO -- MMES -- works actively on protecting florican habitat in the eastern range and I hope to incorporate these visuals into their education programs. - Ramki.

Namdapha is an amazing place for birds, and though we didn't find great bird densities (probably because of transition from winter to breeding), the species diversity was amazing. Photography was very challenging partly because of hunting and also because of extremely thick vegetation and poor light. Shashank is the pied piper of wren-babblers wherever he goes and, needless to say, we bumped into this low elevation wren-babbler a couple of hours into our first trek.

Remarks: It is a great experience to photograph waders in their breeding plumage -- especially the ones that breed elsewhere after wintering in India. It is truly an incredible phenomenon where most waders go through a complete transformation in their appearance.   It was with this in mind that I made a quick trip to Jamnagar. Fellow INW-er Arpit Deomurari very kindly organized and led this trip for us and his expertise was invaluable. It was a dream to get the 'golden cheek-plumes' of this grebe and a full-day trip to the tata salt pans in Charakla (~120 kms from Jamnagar) paid out.   For the first time I stacked TCs (a canon 1.4 and Arpit's tamron 1.4) on an 800mm and 1D Mark IV and they happily auto-focussed. The constant gentle waves of the salt pans are a nightmare to gain focus and one trick that helped was to get as much elevation and shoot-down' on the birds. - RS. Date added to OBI: April 07, 2010.

The crows (hunting in a pack like wild dogs) kept crowding the little bird and finally one crow lifted it clean off the water with its talon's and flew toward the shore. - RS.

Ever since, I have been trying to find one of them on the ground (relying on luck, light, playback) but have failed to return back with anything but sightings of a few (flushed, mostly) Nightjars in their moth-like flights and umpteen recordings of the chuk-chuk-chuk-churrrr calls.  The calls (usually 1-2 birds) start from between 6:57-7:06 PM (never earlier, nor later) and around 15-20 minutes later up to six of them may call simultaneously. I reckon that there are around 8-10 birds (which is a lot fewer than my earlier estimate of c15) in the small area.  Last evening, I marked out two spots, from where the calls nearly always start, which are easy to reach when the sun is not out (the terrain is not without risk for the casual walker, and a slip might have bad consequences, especially since I do not have a decent flashlight). To follow up, I went to the two places at 5:30 AM today morning, but failed to spot or hear anything. In fact, I'm not sure if the nightjars are active at that time in the first place (would anybody enlighten me?).  However, I went to check again at 6:30 PM today and was lucky straightaway. The first of the spots had a surprisingly small (their wings are so long, that the bird's size now seems strangely disproportionate) rock like creature excellently camouflaged with the ground. So much so, I think I might have been seeing the bird all along but have just never spotted it.  This individual allowed me really close and eventually flew off at about 7 PM (and straight after, started calling from wherever it landed). I tried not to use the flash, but eventually had to do so for the last 5 minutes or so. I should have gotten better images, but my camera is pretty lousy beyond ISO200 and I still know very little, if anything, about photography and settings as such.  The joy of finding your own nightjar, by the way, is unparalleled :-) - RS . Date added to OBI: May 15, 2010. Original OBI location name: .",,Caprimulgus affinis,savnig1,Species,,,5.00,1,"",,

Remarks: Photo 1 of this individual in which it is hard to decide whether the bird is a Southern Grey Shrike of the subspecies pallidirostris or a Great Grey Shrike of the race homeyeri. Adults of both these taxa in summer show blackish lores and bill. The primary projection does seem a little on the long side for homeyeri but the plumage is quite worn and it is not possible to count the individual primary feathers projecting beyond the tertials to be sure. Both taxa show similar tertial patterns. What is left of the uppertail coverts and rump look to be pale grey (indicative of pallidirostris) rather than white but this is possible for homeyeri. It required a second photograph (see photo 2 by Igor Karyakin) from a different angle to positively identify this individual. Many thanks for their helpful and constructive comments on this bird to Nial Moores, Björn Johansson and Tim Worfolk; and of course to Igor Karyakin for supplying the photos. - Eds.
