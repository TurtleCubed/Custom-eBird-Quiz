# GeoBird
## Setup
For conda users, run `conda env create -f resources/environment.yml`. I dunno how pip works but I included the `requirements.txt` file as well.

## How to play
1. In geobird.py, set the REGION variable to either "United States", "California", or "Santa Clara County" (request for additional regions to be added).
2. Run geobird.py
3. If all is well, the checklist will be printed in the terminal and a window of Google maps will open. Navigate to where you think the checklist has been and place a pin (do not click a real maps location). There will be a window popup on the bottom with the longitude and latitude. Click the link in that box and that will submit your answer.

Have fun!
